## Kaggle Competition | Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster

The Challenge
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).


## Goal of this notebook

- Importing Data with Pandas
- Cleaning Data
- Exploring Data through Visualizations
- modify data according to our need
- Used different prediction model to see which model give us best prediction
